# Jobsearch Terminal App by Lachy Reynolds

## Purpose

This jobsearch manager app will allow job seekers who regularly apply for jobs to easily manage their job applications in one place. It will allow job seekers to add, remove, update and search their applied jobs.

## Problems it solved

- As a job seeker I found that I would always have trouble finding which job listing site (Seek, Indeed, Jora, etc.) I used to apply for a specific job. A job search manager can help significantly since I can easily look up a job in one place.

- When I got a phone call back from an employer I would sometimes forget that I applied for the job and the phone call became awkward or I seem uninterested. Being able to search through applied jobs on the spot when the employer says "Hi, I'm Jeff from Bunnings", I can search through my applied jobs for all applications for Bunnings.

- Not everyone will have access to the internet, so people may manually apply for jobs, this app does not require internet to run which will make it accessible for those individuals.

- Having to create a table and do the organising yourself can be lots of work which is why I am doing the hard work to creating this wonderful tool for job seekers.
